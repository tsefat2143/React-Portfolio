                Hi Everyone! My name is Tajdidul, aka Taj. 
                By using various programming languages I like to create 
                projects and learn new technologies to better my skills. 
                I have graduated from the City University 
                of New York at Queens College and plan to enjoy the ride 
                of web development. During my weekends, I love to go
                to the gym, play sports, or watch a comedy show.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a Sr. Admin Analyst at the New York Human Resources Administration. 
                I am open to other roles within the United States, so please free to 
                <a href='/#contact'> contact </a> me.
            </p>
        </div>
